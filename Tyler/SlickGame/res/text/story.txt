From the journal of Dr. Balthazar White:

October 1893,

	I have decided to enter the forest. The child's life is at
stake, and I can see no other alternative; the father has lost everything - his wife, and his other two children, to that damned place, and I will do everything in my power to make sure he doesn't lose his last child.

	The white spider that bit the child came to the village by way
of a trade caravan that usually comes to us this time of year. Often they decide to circumvent the dark place, but the snows came early this year, and there was no way through the mountain pass. Although the path through the forest is short, it was enough time to pick up one of the dangerous creatures that lives there - the spider was hiding in a bundle of aspen wood the child's father had ordered the year before. I imagine the child was bitten while helping his father move the parcel to their home.

	The cure for the spider bite can be derived from the very
mushrooms that give the spider its deadly venom. I've heard of frogs in the jungles of South America that similarly get their venom by consuming some other poisonous creature; the frogs themselves are benign if taken from their environs.

	I will have to collect quite a few mushrooms. Some varieties
are more potent than others - perhaps if I'm lucky...

	It will take a fair bit of luck to even get out of that place
alive, though I'm not sure that I'd care to live knowing I didn't try.
