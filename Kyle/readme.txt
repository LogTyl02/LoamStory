KYLE SCHAEFER

AI project/LoamStory

Instructions:

	For now... just compile Main.java and run Main

Currently working on:

	Implementing a DFS algorithm to work on a grid

Files include:

	Grid.java - Holds methods for creating the grid, marking/unmarking objects etc

	Main.java - Just runs the current setup as pushed

	Monst.java - (Should ranme to Wander AI)
		     Contains methods for creating a monster and setting mode to wander AI

	Maps.java - Pretty cool class to make maps, just set a position in the grid to be marked
		    using markObject(x,y); You can layer them together as well like a map editor or something
  		    Eventually I'll implement it to just read from a file so I can just draw it in a text file

Future works:

	Implementing a BFS algorithm after the dfs is finished
	There are quite a few other classes I've worked on but nothing worth commiting at this point
